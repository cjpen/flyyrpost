# FlyyrPost

FlyyrPost is committed to building a community-supported platform that is a comprehensive digital marketing tool for Promoters and Venues to connect directly with their artists and event goers.

FlyyrPost is inspired by the artistry of graphic design within the underground party community. Party flyers have a historical tradition where promoters curate the crowd of their party by presenting a visual sample of the vibe they wish to attract, and thus seek to inspire party revelers to attend. These images contain a record of objective and, arguably more importantly, subjective information that helps the reveler evaluate their decision on how to spend their evening. The concept behind FlyrrPost is to celebrate the party flyer, as it is the ideal method to deliver event information. The archives of these images tell a story unique to each individualâ€™s experience, but transform on a larger scale to become artifacts that represent a cultural expression.
